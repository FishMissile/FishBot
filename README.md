### Fishbot for Discord

Be sure to put your own Discord API token or set your own command prefix in `config.json`

To stram audio from YouTube, the `ytld-core` requires [FFMpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows  "FFMpeg") for Windows.
I had to install this manually as well as [Python 2.7.15](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/ "Python 2.7.15")

Use `node .` to launch

Once it is up and running the default command prefix is ` ` `
Use ` `help` to display a list of commands.
and ` `help <command>` for more information on each command
